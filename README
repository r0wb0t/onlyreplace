onlyreplace.js
==============
by Rowan Nairn - http://eurekaman.com

A javascript library for declarative, progressive enhancement AJAX.

Based on ideas from:
http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-October/023661.html


Usage
-----

1. Include the script (<script src="onlyreplace.js"></script>) anywhere inside
   the <body>

2. Add a data-onlyreplace attribute to any link or form, specifying the ids of 
   elements to replace

This causes the link or form to behave as if it were an AJAX request that 
changed only those sections of the page.  The Back and Forward buttons should
work to change between these states.

See test.html for an example.


Advanced Usage
--------------

After the script has been included you can listen for a "replace" event on the
document with document.addEventListener("replace", function(r){  }, false)

The listener will be passed a mapping of ids to replacement nodes.  If the
listener returns false then the normal replacement will be cancelled, allowing
the listener to do custom replacement animations for example.

See test_custom.html for an example.
